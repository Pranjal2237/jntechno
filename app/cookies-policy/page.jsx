              <b>First and third-party cookies:</b> whether a cookie is 'first'
              or 'third' party refers to the domain placing the cookie.
              First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being
              visited by the user at the time (e.g. cookies placed by
              www.accendotechnologies.com).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Third-party cookies:</b> are cookies that are set by a domain
              other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a
              user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through
              that website this would be a third-party cookie.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Persistent cookies:</b> these cookies remain on a user's device
              for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated
              each time that the user visits the website that created that
              particular cookie.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Session cookies:</b> these cookies allow website operators to
              link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser
              session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes
              when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created
              temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are
              deleted.
