              Are you looking to give your COTS server-based hub hardware a
              boost with software-accelerated traffic processing solutions? If
              yes, then Jonaren Technology has a unique solution known as WireZAP that
              can accelerate the packet processing workloads where there is a
              requirement of ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth massive
              interconnect.
            </p>
            <p>
              WireZAP runs on a white box or ODM products and performs
              high-speed traffic aggregation/disaggregation function, and
              reduces latency to a great extent. The solution also addresses the
              improvement of physical safety by reducing wire clutter in data
              rooms, hospitals, and other critical facilities.
